	<p>"Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players each on a field at the centre of which is a 
	rectangular 22-yard-long pitch. The game is played by 120 million players in many countries, making it the world's 
	second most popular sport. Each team takes its turn to bat, attempting to score runs, while the other team fields. 
	Each turn is known as an innings (used for both singular and plural). </p>

	<p>The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman who attempts to hit the ball with his bat away from the fielders so he can run to the 
	other end of the pitch and score a run. Each batsman continues batting until he is out. The batting team continues batting until ten 
	batsmen are out, or a specified number of overs of six balls have been bowled, at which point the teams switch roles and the fielding team comes in to bat."
